Electricity metres (pre-paid) sometimes pose challenges to users in Zambia, which leads to misconceptions about how much energy is being used, resulting in the miscalculation of how much power one needs to budget for. 
I created this Java programme to give users an idea of how much power they consume and how many days it would last them depending on how much power they bought, therefore, allowing them to make a budget to meet their monthly needs.
